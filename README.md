# clj-wiremock

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexanderjamesking/clj-wiremock.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/alexanderjamesking/clj-wiremock)

A Clojure library that wraps wiremock, very much a work in progress - don't use this just yet! @superaking

Create a wiremock server on port 11111
```
(def server (wiremock-server (wiremock-config { :port 11111 })))
```

Starting and stopping the server
```
(start server)
(stop server)
```

Configure the WireMock client to post to 11111
```(configure-for "localhost" 11111)```

Stub an endpoint using map syntax
```
(stub-for (will-return (GET (url-equal-to "/hello")) 
                       (response { :status 200 :body "Hello World" })))
```

Stub an endpoint using the builder
```
(stub-for (will-return (GET (url-equal-to "/hello-world")) 
                       (-> (response) 
                           (with-body "Hello World")
                           (with-header "Content-Type" "text/plain")
                           (with-status 200))))
```


Example using wiremock in the REPL (lein repl)
```
(import com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.WireMockServer)
(import com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.core.WireMockConfiguration)
(import com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.client.WireMock)

(def wiremock-config (.port (new WireMockConfiguration) 22222))
(def wiremock-config (new WireMockConfiguration))

(def wiremock-server (new com.github.tomakehurst.wiremock.WireMockServer wiremock-config))
(.start wiremock-server)
(WireMock/configureFor "localhost" 22222)


(defn GET [x] (WireMock/get x))
(defn urlEqualTo [x] (WireMock/urlEqualTo x))
(defn stubFor [x] (WireMock/stubFor x))
(defn aResponse [] (WireMock/aResponse))

(stubFor 
  (.willReturn 
    (GET (urlEqualTo "/hello")) 
    (.withBody 
      (.withStatus (aResponse) 200) 
      "Hello World")))


(stubFor 
  (.willReturn 
    (get (urlEqualTo "/hello")) 
    (.withBody 
      (.withStatus (WireMock/aResponse) 200) 
      "Hello World")))

(.stop wiremock-server)
```
